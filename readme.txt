I choose CPP because I am familiar with its basic functionality and multithreading in CPP. I can code the same functionality in
JAVA as I did many projects in JAVA.

We can write more test case as
1. Check the no of arguments and return the ERROR message if argument size is more or less.
2. Add more functionality in ZADD

Map and set data structure is used because it stored in key and value format

Yes Multithreading is required because some process like expire and set nx to require the thread to run for a time to delete after some time
